                  “ ....The walls beyond them were of metal, white and gleaming; there were doorways. In another wall
                  were portholes - round windows of thick glass that framed absolute night. It was dark out beyond them
                  with a blackness that was relieved only by sharp points of brilliance - stars in a night sky such as
                  McGuire had never seen. Past and Present alike were hazy to the flyer; the spark of life had been
                  brought back to his body from a far distance; there was time needed to part the unreal from the real
                  in these new and strange surroundings....” <br>
                  The Wall of Death, Victor Rousseau. <br>

                  Mothership Future Cities Laboratory is an applied research and technology innovation entity, which
                  positions itself at the metaphysical fringes of conventional architectural practice. Inspired in equal
                  part by science-fiction and applied avant-garde, Mothership compulsively looks to blur the boundaries
                  between the built and the imagined with its unusual body of work. Mothership advocates a brand of
                  information-driven spatial intervention that is in constant flux, alive in its response to human
                  stimulus, transcending its role as habitat and embracing that of an enabler and protagonist to human
                  experience. A strong proponent of the integration of both augmented interaction and digital immersion
                  into contemporary practice, Mothership concerns itself both with the weaving of ephemeral digital
                  narratives into the fabric of traditional spatial storytelling as a precursor/catalyst towards
                  synthesizing habitable virtual realities of the future, realized through an eponymous Metaverse it is
                  currently developing. Mothership’s manifesto and practice lies at the unique intersection of research,
                  imagination, creation and application - helping perpetuate new frontiers in what we like to call the
                  Architecture of Experience.

                  Mothership’s Research Unit studies the co-evolving dynamics of design and esthetics - as perpetually
                  imagined through the lenses of art and architectural movements, science fiction, literature, cinema,
                  social and political event, popular and protest cultures, pulp anthologies, musical epochs, furniture,
                  fashion, lifestyle and more. Information is further distilled and catalogued into visual libraries,
                  filtered by context for ease of deploy-ability into industry projects. This resolute research
                  endeavour, a first in our industry, also helps inform the exceptional ideation aptitude within
                  Mothership, realised through the creation o libraries of imaginative art and architectural digital
                  assets we make available to investors and art collectors, as well as through design consultation for
                  select commissioned projects. <br>
                  Mothership is conceiving its own Metaverse - an ambitious, self-initiated project, which will blend
                  themes of space travel, planet and exoplanet colonization, lifeform mutation and speculative evolution
                  into a playable, habitable digital ecosystem. Blending the storytelling intricacy of the breadth of
                  Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, with the modern day interactive-tech juggernaut that is Fortnite, this
                  project completely reshapes the way we live, work and play . <br>
                  Our Technology Innovation teams are invested in continuous research, development and deployment of a
                  gamut of visual immersion technology, with the singular vision of reimagining how we as an industry,
                  and a world at large, interact with what surrounds us. We augment Real Estate experiences through the
                  creation of habitable, interactive digital twins to stunning detail of visual quality, realised by our
                  flagship products the Estate Explorer and the Digital Sales Kits. Fast becoming an industry favourite
                  due to the stunning detail and immersion quality, our products help create bespoke client engagement
                  experiences, boost real estate project sales and also allow for exceptional communication and
                  implementation of design with the fraternity of architects and designers.
