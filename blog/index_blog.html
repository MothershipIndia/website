          <h2>Post-Architecture : What when we <span class="italics">colonise Mars?</span> </h2>

          <p class="text">Ours is a resource intensive industry, one that seeks to take from the earth, often
            irreversibly, the integral parts of the nurturing construct that make this planet habitable. Be it purposing
            or re-purposing of natural resource in their most binary, virgin states, or the creation
            <span class="moreText">of ingenious hybrids that form the bedrock of cities and the unsustainable
              monstrosities we fondly call buildings, our approach has always been selfishly linear - an anthropocentric
              discourse throughout history that has reduced other stakeholders in the process of living on mother earth
              to mere taxonomies and whims of our own devise.<br>

              Everything about how we live, from what we wear to how we work, fundamentals of trade and commerce, to
              belief systems that shape the dynamics between communities, necessitate geographical borders and cause
              wars, have their roots in our myopic perception, use and abuse of resources and the elements. Man's most
              ominous construct yet - religion, stemmed from a collective consciousness of fear that attributed, in the
              style of true anthropocentric whim, identity to the elements - creating the omnipotent entity that is an
              angry God. Ancient religions like Paganism and many polytheistic religions that divide billions today,
              from their infancy and early iterations, ascribed liability for most natural phenomena to the whims of a
              deity figure(s) - Gods of seas, Gods of the wind, Gods of fire and so on.<br>

              While serving to birth moralistic code, even if perpetuated by graybeards and Godmen of often dubious
              credential, they perhaps introduced and unquestionably refined over centuries, concepts of hierarchy,
              blind worship, ownership, inheritance, nepotism, divide and xenophobia into our collective cognitive
              construct. These qualities, coupled with miraculous intellectual strides that give us science and
              medicine, bring us to the brink of an epoch where we as a race are at our most potent, but the very mother
              earth that nurtured and indulged our fancies and fantasies, is in the throes of an apocalyptic peril. We
              don't stop here. Instead, given we are perfecting interstellar travel, we dream now of colonising Mars,
              and inevitably in the future, proxy Marses.<br>

              However, is history the ideal blueprint for planning the beta-futures we envision? Will we abide by the
              same linear, myopic and anthropocentric value-verse when we plan for inter-galactic communities? Can we
              continue to posit ourselves as the protagonist of every story we write as a race? Let us take a step back
              to appreciate the enormity of the task at hand. We venture to a planet devoid of the resource matrix that
              we had at our disposal here, devoid of wind and rain, of the same elemental attributes that lead us to
              shape religion on earth, a hostile landscape where our very existence as a race will be parasitic and
              foreign. We will have no option but to start anew, in a way we have failed to through millennia of
              warnings we chose to ignore on earth - tectonic shifts, ice ages, disease, famine and the inevitability
              that will be nature's holocaust.</p>

          <p class="text">Ours is a resource intensive industry, one thaAn appreciation of ‘what can be’ must
            necessitate a prior and thorough understanding of ‘what is’. This entails a purging of definition and
            jargon, of evaluating existing knowledge through a context-determinate lens, instead of as self-evident and
            <span class="moreText">absolute. No system or construct exists in isolation, and it's properties are
              governed by a plethora of contextual parameters which may in themselves be ephemeral in their existence /
              influence. Our understanding of why societies exist as they do today, in environments fashioned as they
              are, cannot be directly transposed to foreign colonies, because of a decided disparity in contextual
              construct. Neither must this understanding be the barometer for examining the success of the architecture
              of future colonisations. While we do attempt the colonization of Mars at the present locus in our
              evolutionary timeline, it would behoove us to regard our current evolutionary state as fluid - a product
              of parameters we have been chronologically exposed to. This presupposition will ensure our approach to the
              colonization is viewed not as a linear extension of our current state, but rather, a minimally invasive,
              mutualistic attempt with the host planet as an equal stakeholder.<br>

              From an evolutionary standpoint, our species has exhibited a marked proclivity for dispensing with
              physiological excess – from outgrowing vestigial tails and rejecting appendices deemed functionally
              redundant, to developing shorter arms as we embraced upright walking postures. This phenomenon, however,
              seems to exist at odds with the parallel growth of our cranial faculties – which have steadily evolved to
              process more and more quanta of information of increasing complexities. Our cerebral constructs have had
              to adapt to be the foundation of our survival mechanism, essentially because we have never been as
              physically dominant as some of our larger antediluvian counterparts. To that end, it is not surprising
              that we have been able to thrive in organized clusters to leverage a strength in numbers, and find comfort
              in the cooperative constructs of tribes, communities and societies. The ensuing ability to hunt larger
              prey in formation, the ability to tell poisonous fruit from palatable, to predict the advent of seasons
              and other products of our collective cerebral prowess - represented a steadily growing library of useful
              information that needed to be articulated and stored. The very notion of language, expression and Art
              stems from this need for articulation - be it the need for cataloging as templates of methodology, or be
              it for the want to celebrate achievement and epoch.<br>

              Over time, organized religion - a pledged subservience to a created divine, birthed the concept of
              artistic expression as a form of homage; and some of our earliest and finest architectural marvels across
              civilizations, are places of worship. Serving as centers for congregation and affiliation, of recorded
              instruction, legend and lore - they became focal points around which indigenous cultures flourished.<br>

              It is when Art began to outgrow mere expression and take on the mantle of symbol and affiliation, that it
              became the semiotic encapsulation of something much larger than aesthetic experience. From flags that
              fronted the conquests of empires to the incubation of foreign architectural styles that followed their
              conclusion, the politicization of art would irreversibly alter the constructs of culture, community and
              identity. Through centuries of wars, the rise and fall of empires, the Renaissance- a pinnacle of our
              collective aesthetic achievement, the Industrial Revolution and the technological advancement it spawned,
              electronic and lately social media that made the sharing of visual and aural experiences instantaneous
              (and for a time, wonderful) – we eventually witnessed the inevitable - the pseudo-democratization /
              dilution / demise of Art. Context took a backseat in lieu of connotation, and Art completed its
              transformation from a discipline of primal expression to one of derivative individualism on the part of a
              few, and imposed consumption on the part of most.<br>

              This is the epoch we find ourselves in today – an age of expression saturation and stagnation, which in
              industry parlance, we have conveniently termed globalization. We celebrate standardization, and fetishize
              instances of superficial expression that disrupt for the sake of disruption. The diaspora of commercially
              propelled pulp that we call experience normalizes over-stimulation to the extent where over-stimulation
              manifests as collective swathes of homogeneity. Sentiment is borrowed and learned instead of evoked, and
              skylines look to replicate blindly those of superior-world nations. Though we have biologically evolved to
              dispense with excess, as societies today, we are indisputably consumption-centric and programmed by our
              own created constructs to embrace excess. We need a reboot.<br>

              Architects of the future will be tasked with shaping extra terrestrial communities, and it is imperative
              that they cannot further their discourse as a linear extension of current developmental paradigms.
              Architecture, when distilled to its true fundamentals, is essentially a statement of artistic expression
              that facilitates function, governed intrinsically by the context in which it is envisioned. Our current
              unsustainable models preclude true mutualism with context, and are instead selfishly anthropocentric. We
              will need to glean from our vast repertoire of expertise, the zest for exploration and our immense
              scientific fortitude that has even made the thought of such a colonization possible. A planet that is
              virgin and unknown awaits. A spirit of empathy will serve us well.</p>
